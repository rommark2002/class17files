1.Build Language and Syntax:

Maven: Maven uses XML for its build configuration. Developers define project settings and dependencies in a pom.xml file using XML tags and elements.
Gradle: Gradle uses a Groovy-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language) or Kotlin DSL for build configuration. This allows for more flexibility and expressiveness in defining build tasks and dependencies.

2. Plugin System:

Maven: Maven relies on a predefined set of plugins, and adding custom functionality can be challenging.
Gradle: Gradle has a powerful plugin system that allows you to easily integrate custom plugins or write your own to extend build functionality. This makes it more flexible and adaptable to various project requirements.

3. Dependency Management:

Maven: Maven uses a centralized repository called the Central Repository, where it stores and retrieves dependencies. Dependencies are defined in the pom.xml file.
Gradle: Gradle also supports Central Repository but is more flexible in terms of repository management. You can define repositories in the build script, and it supports various dependency notations, including Maven-style, Ivy, and custom repositories.

4. Performance:

Maven: Maven can be slower when dealing with complex multi-module projects because it resolves dependencies and builds sequentially by default.
Gradle: Gradle is designed to handle parallel and incremental builds, potentially leading to faster builds, especially for large projects.

5. Community and Ecosystem:

Maven: Maven has been around longer and has a larger user base and extensive documentation.
Gradle: Gradle has gained popularity in recent years and is known for its flexibility and modern approach to build automation.

6. IDE Integration:

Both Maven and Gradle have good integration with popular integrated development environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse.

7. Compatibility:

Maven: Maven has been widely adopted for a long time, so it may be a better choice for legacy projects or projects with strict organizational requirements.
Gradle: Gradle's flexibility and modern features make it a good choice for new projects or projects that require more advanced build customization.
