This is my super simple arithmethic calculator, below is how it works.

The first thing you see is a greeting introducing you to the device, after which the calculator will sleep for 2 seconds.

The calculator prompts you to enter the first number (num1) which is displayed on the screen at the same time.

After num1 is recorded, the calculator will prompt you to enter a second number (num2) which is displayed as well.

After the 2 numbers are taken, the calcultor will prompt you to enter an operator and it's read as "op" and the system sleeps for 2 seconds.

The calculator prints the result of the $num1 and $num2, assigned as variables, based on the provided "op."

The system sleeps for 1 second and then the cow will say "Thank you."
